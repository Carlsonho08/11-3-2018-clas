    <h2> What is the 2.4 and 5 wifi band</h2>
<p>
  Modern day has been dramatically changed because of the evolution of technology. Life was burdensome and everyday chores consumed too much of our time before the technology was here. Due to the technology we have, the access to education, medicine, industry, transportation etc. has been simplified. One of the thing that everyone use on a daily basis is internet.</p>

<p>  How do we connect to the internet? Majority of the people use internet through WiFi. A facility allowing computers, smartphones, or other devices to connect to the Internet or communicate with one another wirelessly within a particular area.
</p>
<p></p>However, there are 2 different kinds of WiFi main frequencies and not everyone know their similarity and differences. One of them is 2.4 GHz WiFi. The 2.4 GHz is a ratio that cycles 2.4 billion times per second. There are many devices that we use on a daily basis use the same frequencies as the 2.4 GHz WiFi. These devices include microwave, any video devices that use FM carrier, car alarm, bluetooth, and of course the 2.4 GHz WiFi.
</p>
<p>The 2.4 GHz is the most used radio frequencies in the US. And the WiFi that uses it will have a large range and long waves. It is able to  get through walls and solid objects easily. On the other hand, because of its large range and long waves, it will definitely get a slower speed to the internet and will have some drop connections.
  In fact, the Purple writer once written “The 2.4 Ghz extended range meant that an increasing number of devices (from baby monitors to bluetooth) were using the same frequency, causing it to become overcrowded and slower. “(The History of WiFi, 2014)
</p>
<p>On the other hand, the second main frequency for WiFi, the 5GHz has a totally opposite characteristic. It has a smaller range but a faster connection to the internet. As you can tell the meaning of GHz is a billion cycle per second. The 5Ghz ratio cycles 5 billion times per second. It is about 2 times faster than the 2.4 GHz and about half of the range of the 2.4 Ghz. Its higher frequencies allow data to be transmitted faster and stay with a stable connection.
</p>
<p>Also giving credit for 5 Ghz, 5 Ghz allow us to use a new technology called beamforming. It does not work as the traditional radio signal that goes in every directions. The beamforming is a strong point to point connection.  It reduce the direction where the signal is going and empower the signal strength to a direction which create a larger range and stronger connection to a device.
</p>
<p>While the 2.4 GHz covers about 20-30 ft, the 5 GHz only covers 10-15ft. But with the beamforming, the 5 Ghz can reach a range of 40 ft.  Also the maximum speed for the 2.4 band is 600 Mbps and the maximum speed for the 5 band is 1300 Mbps.
</p>
<p>Both of the bands uses radio waves to transmit information across a network. Devices that uses WiFi will include a wireless adapter that can translate data sent into a radio signal. The same signal will be transmitted to a decoder known as the router. Once the data is decoded, the data will be sent to the Internet through a wired Ethernet connection.
</p>Both wireless network works as a two way traffic, the data received form the internet will also pass through the router to be coded into a radio signal that will be received by the devices. Therefore, both WiFi bands are not actually wireless. They need to be connection to a router through radio signal, and the router need to be connection to the wired internet for you to use the internet.
