  <h1> Which is better ?</h1>
  <p>Some people might ask which wifi band is better? My answer to that is do not worries about which one is better because most of the router in the market has a dual band system which create both the 2.4 and 5 Ghz signal. It allows you to use 2.4 when you are far from the router and use 5 Ghz when you are close.
</p>
<p>As the prices of the router are getting cheaper every year. What you really need to think of is not if you should upgrade to a 5 Ghz or lower to 2.4 Ghz. Instead of thinking about how to use each device or signal. What you should really think of is what is situation is like. If you are only using the Wifi to browse websites and send email, then the 2.4 Ghz might be your choice. If you are a game person or video person, then the 5 Ghz band will be your choice.
</p>
<p>The use of WiFi today is summed up nicely by Rethink Wireless: “WiFi performance continues to improve and it’s one of the most ubiquitous wireless communications technologies in use today. It’s easy to install, simple to use and economical too. “ (Rethink Team, 2016) Of course there are many more different frequencies used for WiFi signal, but those are for server size user and some secret signal for the government. As our technology get
  more and more advanced, I believe that more and more frequencies will be open to the market. However, we have to stick to this right now.
